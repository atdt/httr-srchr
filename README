httr-srchr
~~~~~~~~~~
`httr-srchr` tells you where IO is happening in your filesystem.
It spends several seconds (5 by default) watching file access on
all disk-backed mountpoints, and then prints the top N (default 3)
file paths, sorted by number of bytes written during the window.

The name was Giuseppe's idea.
